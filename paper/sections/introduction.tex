\section{Introduction}
Most of the preliminary work we've done so far involves loading in the data and running basic summary statistics. Our group has also written functions to pull and graph the dvars (RMS of the signal derivatives) and the framewise displacement. We use that in conjunction with the mean signal of the BOLD data to identify outliers and use that in the near future to process our data further. We have also begun rough functions to calculate the betas and begin logistic regression.
