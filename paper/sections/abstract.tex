% Abstract
\par Our paper is the \textit{Neural Basis of Loss Aversion in Decision-Making Under Risk} \cite{Tom2007LossAversion}. The experiment investigates the phenomenon of loss aversion - where individuals decisions are influenced by the amount of potential loss more than they are by the amount of potential gains. The experiment involved giving 16 subjects 256 combinations of gain/loss of dollars with a 50/50 chance. The subject's decisions of whether to accept or reject of each of the proposed gambles were measured as well as their brain activity in the fMRI machine. The behavioral data file records the subjects responses and to which combination of values, and the BOLD data file records the subjects neurological reponse in 4-dimensional fMRI data.
