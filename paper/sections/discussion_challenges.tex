\subsection{Discussion of Challenges}

\par \indent One of the major challenges is trying to make this project as reproducible as possible while following guidlines on documentation, testing functions, and attempting to produce the results of the paper using our limited understanding of fMRI data. Travis CI bugs with various versions of python, coverage failures, and errors with directory/path locations often hinder the process of smooth workflows. Collaboration between five group members is no doubt difficult as we found it hard to come up with an attainable final goal that is still rewarding. 
\par Technically, most of us are new to python programming and reseach using git workflows, thus we have only a preliminary understanding of the various python resources available for our use. Additionally, lack of statistical understanding of some aspects of the paper has urged us to do independent research. Yet the disconnent between theory and implementation has been a major obstacle as we try to put our knowledge into practice. 
\par Some problems can be solved or alleviated by defined checkpoints and making the effort to read and re-read the paper and ask questions. Further, as we familiarize ourselves more and more  with various python modules and toolkits, results can be easier to attain and interpret.
