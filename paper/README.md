##Paper

The makefile is written such that:

- `make all` will generate our paper in PDF format
- `make clean` will delete all extraneous files generated by 'make all'

report.pdf is the final report, and is built from the separate raw .tex 
sections in the sections subdirectory.

The figures subdirectory contains the figures needed for the report. It already
contains the needed figures but will also hold the appropriate figures if one 
chooses to generate all figures using the make commands in project or 
code/utils/scripts
