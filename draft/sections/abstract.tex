% Abstract
\par Our paper is the \textit{Neural Basis of Loss Aversion in Decision-Making
Under Risk} \cite{Tom2007LossAversion}. The experiment investigates the 
phenomenon of loss aversion - where individuals decisions are influenced by the
amount of potential loss more than they are by the amount of potential gains. 

\par 
Our analysis of the paper aims to verify this result and to replicate the connections found between neural loss aversion (shown in brain activation) and behavioral loss aversion (shown in the actual decisions to accept or reject gambles based on potential gain/loss). Our work has found that the neural loss aversion is [placeholder] and that the behavioral loss aversion is [placeholder]. 
Our work also shows that neural and behavioral loss aversion are [placeholder], and that female and male subjects exhibit [placeholder].
