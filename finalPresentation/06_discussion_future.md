# Potential Future Work

## Model diagnostics methods on behavorial regressors (logistic)
### Add response time until decision as a regressor
### How well does the model classify reject/accept behavior given new gamble 
task: confusion matrix, ROC curve (looking at performance as we vary discrimate 
threshold)
### Look at AIC and do model selection of different models

## Model diagnostic of neural model (linear)
### Apply formal tests of normality
### Address autocorrelation with other methods besides convolution

## Other brain images
