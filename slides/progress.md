# Background

## The Paper

- from OpenFMRI.org
- ds005

## The Data

- 16 subjects
- 4 conditions per subject

## The Method

- linear regression(?)

# Initial work

## EDA

- downloaded data
- simple plots, summary statistics

# Next steps

## Preprocessing / Validation

- PCA

## Statistical Analysis

- linear model

# Our Process

## Hardest part of process?
- Working with the FMRI data and trying to understand our paper
- Keeping up with documentation 

## Success in overcoming these obstacles?
- Using git workflows to raise issue and problems for the group.
- Limited success in the FMRI part, still figuring things out. 

# Our Process Part 2
## Issues facing the team?
- Debugging each other's code when travis CI fails in a pull request
- Addressing this by meeting up for teamwork or ask for help

## Most helpful?
- Python/numpy, lab sections with git workflows

## Most confusing?
- FMRI lectures

# Our Process Part 3

## What do you need to do to successfully complete the project?
- Have a clear idea of what we can get done
- Make work as reproducible as possible

## Diffuculty in reproducibility?
- Very frustrating if Travis fails on a pull request
- Remembering to write documentation in the scripts
- Test functions for plotting functions are hard to write/assert
- With a lot of work we may be able to get most of it reproducible

## Remaining weeks:
- Mostly unstructured time would be helpful
- Could cover:
  - Software tools like statmodels, make
  - More regression: linear and logistic
