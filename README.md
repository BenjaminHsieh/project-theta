[SOME SUMMARY OF PAPER]

## Instructions

- `make clean` will delete extraneous files created by our scripts
- `make coverage` will check the coverage of our data, code directories 
- `make test` will run the tests in our code/utils/tests and code/data/tests directory
- `make verbose` is the verbose version of 'make test'

To replicate our project one should, in this order, read the READMEs and run the make commands in:

1. the data directory to generate, unzip, and validate the necessary datasets
2. the code directory to check the tests and coverage
3. [GENERATE IMAGES/ANALYSIS? need to implement]
4. the paper directory to generate and clean the final report


[NEED TO ADD: instructions for data, scripts/analysis, paper (should be done in that order)]
